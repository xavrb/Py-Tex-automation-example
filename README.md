# pyTexBusinessCards

Getting your business card nice and clean with a single line.


## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development, testing and creation purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them, I use Fedora but commands should not differ that much on debian based systems (please change accordingly).

I assume you have a working Python and Tex environments working.

```shell
# dnf install texlive-fontspec

# dnf install texlive-labels

```

#### Lato Font

For the business cards I use Lato, an elegant and nice font you can find at Google Fonts, download it and install on your system (Regular style will do the trick here)
